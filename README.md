# Introduction
In Malaysia, most of the retail investors will get the stock tips and information from untrusted sources (e.g. Facebook groups, Youtube channels, blogs) that leads to herd-effect in stock investment, according to Bursa Malaysia. The core concept of "InvestBook" is to create a community for retail investors to get authentic stock information.

At "InvestBook", we created an algorithm that can analyze the user comments and reactions (like and share) on the video, then predict and evaluate the trust score of the video content. The trust score will assist the users to filter untrusted content and prevent misjudgement on their investment.

# Awards
"InvestBook" had been shortlisted as Top 10 finalists in the hackathon "InvestHack" in December 2020.
"InvestHack" is the first retail investment hackathon in Malaysia, hosted by Bursa Malaysia (NASDAQ-like stock exchange centre), to create and present potential innovative solutions to enhance retail participation in the marketplace.
